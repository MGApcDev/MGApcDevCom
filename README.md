# MGApcDevCom
My personal Drupal 8 site.

All relevant database login information should have been excluded, but if I've made a mistake feel free to inform me.

For the site I'm using a custom theme, it's likely not very interesting for other people, but feel free to use it if you want.

## Installation
1. Download the repo to server or local environent: `git clone https://github.com/MGApcDev/MGApcDevCom.git`
2. Copy default.settings.php and rename it to -> settings.php and add database properties
3. Create database:

  3a. Create empty database and run through the drupal install process 
  
  3b. Or use existing database and copy existing files folder to: `/sites/default/`
4. There you go --> run drupal's `update.php` just in case and you should be good to go

## Usage
Do whatever you want.. obviously my templates will only be usefull if you're using the same content types
